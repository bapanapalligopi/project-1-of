To use **PMD (Programming Mistake Detector)** with a Spring Boot application without installing any plugins, you can configure it to run via an external **`pmd.xml`** configuration file. This is useful if you prefer to integrate PMD as part of your build process or run it as a standalone tool rather than integrating it directly into your IDE.

Here’s how you can set it up by configuring **PMD with Maven** (assuming you're using Maven, which is typical for Spring Boot projects). The idea is to include PMD in your build process, reference the configuration file from the `resources` directory, and then run PMD as part of your build.

### **Steps to Use PMD with a `.xml` File in the `resources` Directory:**

### 1. **Add PMD Plugin to `pom.xml` (Maven)**

First, you need to add the PMD plugin to your Maven build configuration. This plugin will analyze the code according to the rules defined in the PMD configuration XML file.

In your `pom.xml`, add the following under the `<plugins>` section:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-pmd-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.13.0</version> <!-- Or use the latest version -->
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <phase>validate</phase> <!-- PMD will run in the validate phase -->
                    <goals>
                        <goal>pmd</goal>
                    </goals>
                    <configuration>
                        <rulesets>
                            <!-- Specify the location of your custom PMD configuration -->
                            <ruleset>file:${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/pmd.xml</ruleset>
                        </rulesets>
                        <!-- Optional: Fail the build if violations are found -->
                        <failOnViolation>true</failOnViolation>
                    </configuration>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

In this configuration:
- The PMD plugin is set to run during the **validate** phase of the Maven build.
- The **`ruleset`** points to your custom PMD XML file (`src/main/resources/pmd.xml` in this case).
- The `failOnViolation` flag, when set to `true`, will cause the build to fail if there are any PMD rule violations.

### 2. **Create Your Custom `pmd.xml` Configuration File**

Next, create the PMD configuration file (`pmd.xml`) in the `src/main/resources` directory of your project. This file contains the PMD rules that define which checks should be applied to your code.

Example of a basic `pmd.xml` configuration:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<pmd>
    <!-- Basic PMD rules -->
    <ruleset name="My Custom Ruleset">
        <!-- Exclude rules you don't want to run -->
        <rule ref="rulesets/java/controversial.xml" />
        <rule ref="rulesets/java/design.xml" />
        <rule ref="rulesets/java/codestyle.xml" />
        <rule ref="rulesets/java/unusedcode.xml" />
    </ruleset>
</pmd>
```

You can configure various rules in this file, such as:
- **`rulesets/java/controversial.xml`**: Contains rules related to controversial practices (e.g., empty catch blocks, etc.).
- **`rulesets/java/design.xml`**: Rules about code design (e.g., cyclomatic complexity).
- **`rulesets/java/codestyle.xml`**: Coding style guidelines (e.g., indentation, method naming conventions).
- **`rulesets/java/unusedcode.xml`**: Rules about unused code (e.g., unused private methods or variables).

You can also create custom rules in the XML file by defining them within `<rule>` tags.

### 3. **Run PMD During the Build Process**

After you’ve configured the plugin and the XML file, you can now run PMD as part of your Maven build process.

1. To run PMD manually, execute the following command in your terminal from the root of your project:

   ```bash
   mvn pmd:pmd
   ```

   This will analyze your code and generate a PMD report based on the rules defined in your `pmd.xml` file.

2. If you want PMD to be automatically executed as part of your build, just run the standard Maven build:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

   During the `validate` phase of the build, PMD will be executed, and it will check your code against the rules specified in the `pmd.xml` file.

### 4. **Viewing PMD Reports**

By default, PMD will generate a report in the `target/pmd` directory. You can view the results in the generated `target/pmd.html` file.

- After running `mvn clean install` or `mvn pmd:pmd`, PMD will output its results to an HTML or XML report (depending on your configuration).
- You can access this file to review the issues that PMD found in your code.

For example, to view the PMD report:

```bash
open target/pmd/pmd.html
```

Or if you're using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, you can open this HTML report directly.

### **5. Customizing PMD Behavior**

You can fine-tune PMD’s behavior by modifying the `pmd.xml` configuration file to include additional rulesets, specify particular rules, or adjust the severity levels for violations.

For example, to customize the severity of the "Avoid static method calls" rule:

```xml
<rule ref="rulesets/java/unusedcode.xml">
    <properties>
        <property name="ignoreMethodCalls" value="false"/>
    </properties>
</rule>
```

You can also exclude specific files or classes by adding `exclude` patterns in the plugin configuration, or configure the rule sets to only apply to certain packages or classes.

---

### **6. (Optional) Run PMD in CI/CD Pipeline**

If you are using a **CI/CD pipeline** (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.), you can automate PMD checks as part of your build process. Ensure that the configuration file (`pmd.xml`) is included in your version-controlled repository and the Maven `pmd` plugin is correctly set up in the CI pipeline.

For example, in Jenkins:
- Include the `mvn pmd:pmd` goal in your pipeline script.
- Set up Jenkins to fail the build if there are PMD violations by checking the PMD report.

---

### **Conclusion**

Using PMD without plugins directly in your IDE is completely possible with Maven and a custom `pmd.xml` configuration file in the `resources` directory. By configuring the PMD Maven plugin and creating the rules in your XML file, you can integrate PMD into your build process and run it easily without needing any additional IDE setup.
