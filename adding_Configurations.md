If you have a separate Git repository for configuration management, there are several approaches you can take to integrate it with your Spring Boot application. This is a common practice in large-scale systems where configuration needs to be managed outside of the code repository for separation of concerns, better version control, and centralized management.

Here’s how you can manage external configurations for your Spring Boot application:

### **1. Use Spring Cloud Config**
Spring Cloud Config is a powerful tool for centralized configuration management, especially when your application is part of a microservices architecture.

#### Steps to Use Spring Cloud Config:

1. **Set Up the Spring Cloud Config Server:**
   Create a new Spring Boot project (or use your existing configuration repository) for the config server. You’ll need a separate repository for the config server if you don't have one yet.

   **Add dependencies to your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`:**
   ```xml
   <!-- Spring Cloud Config Server -->
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-cloud-config-server</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. **Enable Config Server:**
   In your Spring Boot application's main class, add `@EnableConfigServer` to mark it as a configuration server.
   ```java
   @SpringBootApplication
   @EnableConfigServer
   public class ConfigServerApplication {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           SpringApplication.run(ConfigServerApplication.class, args);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Configure `application.properties` for Config Server:**
   Point to your external Git repository where configuration files are stored. Here’s an example of how to configure it in the `application.properties` of your config server:
   ```properties
   server.port=8888
   spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=https://github.com/your-org/your-config-repo
   spring.cloud.config.server.git.clone-on-start=true
   ```

4. **Store Config Files in Git Repository:**
   - In your Git repository, store configurations like `application.yml`, `application-dev.yml`, `application-prod.yml`, etc.
   - Each service (or Spring Boot application) can have a corresponding configuration file stored in Git.
   
5. **Add Config Client to Your Spring Boot Application:**
   Now, in your Spring Boot application (client), you can pull configurations from the Spring Cloud Config server.

   **Add Spring Cloud Config Client Dependency:**
   ```xml
   <!-- Spring Cloud Config Client -->
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-config</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```

6. **Configure the Client to Use Config Server:**
   In your application’s `application.properties` or `application.yml`, configure it to point to the Config Server.
   ```properties
   spring.application.name=your-app-name
   spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8888  # or your config server URL
   spring.profiles.active=dev
   ```

   With this setup, when you start your application, it will fetch configurations from the Config Server.

7. **Run the Application:**
   When you run your application, it will fetch its configurations from the Spring Cloud Config server, which in turn pulls it from your Git repository.

### **2. Use External Configuration Files**
If you're not using Spring Cloud Config and want to load configuration directly from a Git repository or an external file, you can use these approaches:

#### **a. Mount Git Repository as a File System in Docker (or any containerized environment):**
If you deploy your Spring Boot application inside Docker, you can mount the configuration files stored in your Git repository to your container.

- Clone the repository containing your configuration files onto your server.
- Mount the directory containing the configurations as a volume when you run your container.
  
  Example:
  ```bash
  docker run -v /path/to/config-repo:/config your-spring-boot-app
  ```
  Spring Boot will load configuration from `/config` directory inside the container.

#### **b. Pull Configurations Programmatically:**
If you're running Spring Boot without Spring Cloud Config and want to pull configuration files dynamically at runtime, you can write a small service that fetches and loads configuration files from a Git repository.

You can use libraries like **JGit** (for Git operations) and Spring’s `Environment` to load properties at runtime.

Example:
1. Add JGit to your `pom.xml`:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.eclipse.jgit</groupId>
       <artifactId>org.eclipse.jgit</artifactId>
       <version>5.10.0.202012080501-r</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. Implement a class that fetches configuration from a Git repository:
   ```java
   import org.eclipse.jgit.api.Git;
   import org.eclipse.jgit.api.errors.GitAPIException;
   import java.io.File;
   
   public class GitConfigLoader {
       private String repoUrl = "https://github.com/your-org/your-config-repo.git";
       private String branch = "main";  // or your branch name

       public void loadConfig() throws GitAPIException {
           File localRepo = new File("/tmp/config-repo");
           Git.cloneRepository()
              .setURI(repoUrl)
              .setDirectory(localRepo)
              .setBranch(branch)
              .call();
           
           // Now, you can load the configuration from the local repo directory
           // e.g., using Properties or YAML parser.
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Load these configurations into the Spring Environment:**
   Once you have fetched the configurations, you can manually load them into Spring’s `Environment` to be used in your application.

---

### **3. Using Spring Boot Profiles with Externalized Configuration**
You can also use **Spring Boot’s support for externalized configuration** to load properties from different sources, including a Git repository or external files.

- **Use `spring.config.location`** to point Spring Boot to external configuration files, for example:
  ```properties
  spring.config.location=classpath:/default-config/,file:/path/to/your/external/config/
  ```

  You can configure it to point to a directory that you sync with your Git repository or to a URL if you're fetching configurations remotely.

---

### **4. Automation:**
If you’re managing configuration with a Git repository and updating configurations frequently, it’s beneficial to automate the process of fetching and applying changes:
- **Webhooks**: Trigger a webhook when a configuration file changes in the Git repository, which then triggers a restart or reloading of the application.
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Integrate configuration updates into your CI/CD pipelines to ensure that configurations are deployed alongside application changes.

### **5. Secure Sensitive Information:**
Never store sensitive information like passwords or API keys in your Git configuration repository. Instead:
- Use **Spring Cloud Vault** or another secret management service.
- Use environment variables or secure systems like **AWS Secrets Manager** to manage sensitive data.

---

### **Conclusion:**
In a real-world Spring Boot application, managing configurations in an external Git repository can be done using tools like **Spring Cloud Config** for centralized management or by simply linking your Spring Boot application to external configuration files using Docker volumes or custom code.

Which approach you choose depends on the scale of your application and whether you're working in a microservices architecture or a simpler monolithic setup.
